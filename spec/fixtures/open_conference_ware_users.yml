    I'm Quentin.

    Quentin Jerome Tarantino (born March 27, 1963) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer and actor. He rose to fame in the early 1990s as an independent filmmaker whose films used nonlinear storylines and aestheticization of violence. His films include Reservoir Dogs (1992), Pulp Fiction (1994), Jackie Brown (1997), Kill Bill (Vol. 1 2003, Vol. 2 2004) and Death Proof (2007). His films have earned him Academy, BAFTA and Palme d'Or Awards and he has been nominated for Emmy and Grammy Awards. In 2007, Total Film named him the 12th greatest director of all-time.

    I'm Aaron.

    In the Bible, Aaron (אהרן), or Aaron the Levite (אהרן הלוי), was the brother of Moses. He was the great-grandson of Levi (Exodus 6:16-20)[1] and represented the priestly functions of his tribe, becoming the first High Priest of the Hebrews. While Moses was receiving his education at the Egyptian royal court and during his exile among the Midianites, Aaron and his sister remained with their kinsmen in the eastern border-land of Egypt (Goshen). He there gained a name for eloquent and persuasive speech; so that when the time came for the demand upon the Pharaoh to release Israel from captivity, Aaron became his brother’s "nabi", or spokesman, to his own people (Exodus 4:16)[2] and, after their unwillingness to hear, to the Pharaoh himself (Exodus 7:9).[3] He is said to have flourished about 1200 BC (traditionally 1597 BC).
