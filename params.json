It remains under heavy development, documentation is scant, tests are incomplete, and the sample theme is broken. These issues are slowly being resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nInstalling this application requires familiarity with *UNIX* system administration and *Ruby on Rails* applications.\r\n\r\nThis application will run best on a UNIX-based dedicated server or virtual machine, and may not run at all on cheap shared hosting because these often restrict the CPU cycles and memory you're allowed to use below what this application requires.\r\n\r\nTo install the application and its dependencies:\r\n\r\n1. Install Git: <http://git-scm.com/>\r\n\r\n2. Checkout the OpenConferenceWare source code:\r\n\r\n        git clone git://github.com/igal/openconferenceware.git\r\n\r\n3. Install Ruby 1.8.6 or 1.8.7 from <http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/> or Ruby Enterprise Edition from <http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/download.html>\r\n\r\n4. Install RubyGems 1.3.6 or newer 1.3.x version from <http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems>\r\n\r\n5. Install Bundler by running the following, likely as `root` or using `sudo`:\r\n\r\n        gem install bundler\r\n\r\n6. Go into the checkout directory created by `git clone` above:\r\n\r\n        cd openconferenceware\r\n\r\n7. Install the application's libraries:\r\n\r\n        bundle install\r\n\r\n8. Optionally configure a custom database, see `config/database.yml` for details.\r\n\r\n9. Create your databases using its native tools or by running:\r\n\r\n        bundle exec rake db:create:all\r\n\r\n10. Run the application's interactive setup and follow its instructions -- WARNING, this will destroy your database's contents:\r\n\r\n        bundle exec rake setup\r\n\r\n11. Or run the application's interactive setup which pre-populates your database with sample data -- WARNING, this will destroy your database's contents:\r\n\r\n        bundle exec rake setup:sample\r\n\r\n12. If you intend to setup a production server, you should consider using Phusion Passenger from <http://www.modrails.com/> or Thin <http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/>\r\n\r\n13. If you intend to deploy releases to a production server, consider using Capistrano and read the `config/deploy.rb` file.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecurity\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThis application runs with insecure settings by default to make it easy to get started, and will warn you about this each time you start it. These default settings include publicly-known cryptography keys that will let anyone get administrator privileges on your application. To secure your application, create a `config/secrets.yml` file with your secret settings based on the instructions in the `config/secrets.yml.sample` file.\r\n\r\n\r\nCustomization\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nYou can customize the application's appearance and behavior by creating a theme, read the `themes/README.txt` file.\r\n\r\n*WARNING:* If you are running a fork of this software, you should be able to customize everything by modifying the theme and config files. If you find yourself modifying anything else, you may be doing it wrong and should [get in touch](http://github.com/igal/) to discuss if we can figure out a way to make the platform more generic to support your needs.\r\n\r\n*WARNING:* The methods and instance variables used within the theme's application layout are in a state of flux as the software evolves. These will be stabilized for the eventual 1.0 release. In the meantime, please watch the changes made to the `bridgepdx` theme's layout and incorporate them into your own, e.g.:\r\n\r\n        git log -p themes/bridgepdx/layouts/application.html.erb\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvironmental variables\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nYou can alter the application's behavior by setting environmental variables. For example, to use the `bridgepdx` theme you can run:\r\n    THEME=bridgepdx ./script/server\r\n\r\nApplication behavior is affected by these environmental variables:\r\n\r\n- `THEME=foo` forces the system to use the `foo` theme. You can also put the name of the theme into the `config/theme.txt` file in `RAILS_ROOT`.\r\n- `NO_MIGRATION_CHECK=1` disables the check that ensures the database has had all the migrations applied.\r\n- `EXCEPTION_NOTIFIER=1` forces the exception notification system to run, it's only used by default in `production` and `preview` environments.\r\n- `EXCEPTION_EMAILS=1` forces the exception notification system to actually send emails, it's only not used by default in `test` and `development` environments.\r\n- `QUERYTRACE=1` provides logging that shows where each database query is done, handy for identifying unwanted queries.\r\n- `VERBOSE_LOAD=1` enables verbose logging of all `require` and `load` statements in the application.\r\n\r\nThe \"bridgepdx\" theme's behavior is affected by these environmental variables:\r\n\r\n- `LOCALCSS=1` forces the use of local CSS files when using the `production` or `preview` environments, these default to using the CSS files on the production servers.\r\n- `WEBANALYTICS=1` forces the inclusion of web analytics tracking in the layout, this is enabled by default in the `production` environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nMailing list\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPlease join the mailing list if you're interested in using or developing the software: <http://groups.google.com/group/openconferenceware>\r\n\r\n\r\nIssue tracker\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nFound a bug?
